# RPGC
you cant spell rampage without RPG

a version of my Rampage compiler written in VB.

(Visual BASIC was chosen because it is my favorite language and to spite the people who say that VB canâ€™t be used for anything.)

RPGC is a .Net version of the IBM RPGLE compiler. Written to address the need to practice the language on a 
platform that is significantly cheaper, as well as more easily controlled, than IBM iSeries server.
Also because I always wanted to make a compiler.

The ultimate goal of the compiler is to mimic RPG4 in both Free and structured format styles.
