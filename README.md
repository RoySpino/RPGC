# RPGC
a version of my RPGLE compiler written in VB.

(Visual BASIC was chosen because it is my favorite language and to spite the people who say that VB canâ€™t be used for anything.)

RPGC is a .Net version of the IBM RPGLE compiler. Written to address the need to practice the language on a 
platform that is significantly cheaper, as well as more easily controlled, tan IBM iSeries server.
Also because I always wanted to make a compiler.
